            <p class=body>This realatively new game, having only been released June of 2020, is one of the most popular games right now. Valorant is a FPS game, and it is like a mix between CS:GO and Overwatch. It is a 5v5 fps shooter where there are attackers trying to plant the bomb, and if the bomb blows up the attackers win, but if the defenders defuse the bomb or take out all the attackers before they plant the bomb the defenders win. Even though this game is very new it already has a very established competitive scene with dozens of teams and millions of fans supporting the teams. There have been many tournaments, but the best one has yet to come, it is called Valorant Champions.</p>
