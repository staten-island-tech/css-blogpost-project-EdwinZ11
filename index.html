            <p class=body-one>This realatively new game, having only been released June of 2020, is one of the most popular games right now. Even though this game is very new it already has a very established competitive scene with dozens of teams and millions of fans supporting the teams.  </p>

            <p class=body-two>This simple but addicting game has been around since 2007. Osu! is a rythm game, where you click circles on the screen to the beat of the music. Though unexpected, this game does have a competitive scene, where players form teams and they compete with each other to win tournaments. Although many of the tournaments are on a small scale, there is one big tournament every year called the Osu! World Cup.</p>
